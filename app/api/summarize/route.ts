Your job is to:

- Extract key highlights related to setup, delivery, finishes, pricing, location, and concerns.

- Assign a lead status: Fresh, In the Works, Hot, Commitment, Sale Paperwork, Delivered, Closed & Booked.
- Recommend the best next step (e.g. phone call, text, handwritten letter, meeting).
- Explain WHY that follow-up step is best and HOW to approach it (with empathy, urgency, etc).
- Suggest coaching tips for the sales rep based on what the customer needs (urgency, clarity, empathy).
- Include regional alerts: If the state is Ohio, remind that porches are required on all exits to pass inspection.
